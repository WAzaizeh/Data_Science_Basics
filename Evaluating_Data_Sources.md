1. Sampling period includes major holiday. This can bias the availability due to higher volume of vacationers, likelihood to offer a place on AirBnb due to need for space during holiday, increased price due to higher demand, etc... Change sampling period to avoid major holidays or reframe question to 'What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam during christmas holiday?'.

2. Again, sampling period includes a major effect that will cause bias. Change sampling period to avoid major events or use data from NYC only before and after the events and reframe question to 'How do patterns of mental health use vary after a major traumatic event?'.

3. Overrepresentation of university students. Skewed population. Change question to 'What are the most common reasons Armenians university students visit local pubs?'
